## Overview

ThingsBoard has ability to store binary content (files) in the database.
Currently it is used to store report files generated by [Generate Dashboard Report Node](/docs/user-guide/rule-engine-2-0/nodes/action/generate-dashboard-report/).
Stored files are accessed by [Send Email Node](/docs/user-guide/rule-engine-2-0/nodes/external/send-email/) to create email attachments.
Another way to send a file is the [REST API Call Node](/docs/user-guide/rule-engine-2-0/nodes/external/rest-api-call/).
User can access stored files using **Files** or **Reports** widgets which is part of **Files** Widgets Bundle.
